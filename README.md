# Fire & Smoke Detection

## Problem Statement
Fire outbreaks in factories, companies, and homes pose significant risks to society and human interests. To mitigate these dangers, we have developed a fire and smoke detection system that utilizes deep learning and surveillance cameras to detect potential hazards in real-time.

## Solution Overview
Our application leverages advanced computer vision algorithms to analyze video footage from cameras and instantly notifies users via a mobile app if fire or smoke is detected. This enables users to take prompt action, such as contacting emergency services.

The system is cost-effective, scalable, and reliable, ensuring high accuracy and broad area coverage, making it an ideal solution for enhancing fire safety in public spaces.
