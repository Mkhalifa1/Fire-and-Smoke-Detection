# Fire & Smoke Detection

## Problem Statement
Fire outbreaks in factories, companies, and homes pose significant risks to society. To address these dangers, we have developed a fire and smoke detection system that utilizes deep learning and surveillance cameras to detect potential hazards in real time.

## Solution Overview
Our system employs advanced computer vision algorithms to analyze video footage from cameras and instantly notifies users via a mobile app if fire or smoke is detected. This enables prompt actions, such as contacting emergency services. The system is:
- **Cost-effective**: Works with any camera.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for various environments.
- **Reliable**: Offers high accuracy and broad coverage, making it ideal for public fire safety.
